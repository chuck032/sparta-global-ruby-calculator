For this project I was tasked with making a functional calculator using only ruby. The calculator has 4 different functions basic, advanced, BMI and trip calculator.

## Basic calculator

* subtraction
* multiplication
* division

## Advanced calculator

Functions:

* power
* square root

## BMI calculator

* Imperial measurements
* Metric measurements

## Trip calculator

Entering four different inputs (distance, fuel efficiency, cost per gallon & speed) will work out the length of time it takes for you to get to your destination and will also work out the total cost of travel.
